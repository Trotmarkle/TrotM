## Elevator pitch
The antartic environment of the Biscoe island has caused the penguins from Biscoe to be materially larger than the penguins from Torgensen and Dream.

import pandas as pd
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
penguins = load_penguins()

__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## Question|Task 1

Finish the Course Setup, and post any questions to getting your environment working smoothly in your course Slack channel




```{python}
#| label: Affect of environment on Penguins
#| code-summary: Compares the flipper length and body of penguins from different islands.
#| fig-cap: "Environment and growth"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here

# Load the penguins dataset
penguins = load_penguins()

LetsPlot.setup_html()
(ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = "flipper_length_mm", y = "body_mass_g", color = "island")
) +
### Body mass and flipper length are compared variables, Island of origin is plotted to find relationship between environment and size.
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = False))
```

The penguins on Biscoe were signifigantly larger than the penguins from Tergensen and Dream.

## Question|Task 2

Recreate the example chart from PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization of the textbook.

Flipper size and body mass are connected to the environment that the penguins have to endure. 
```{python}
#| label: Affect of Islands on Flipper and body mass
#| code-summary: Islands, Flipper, Body Mass
#| tbl-cap: "Affect of Islands on Flipper and body mass"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Include and execute your code here
    
import pandas as pd
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
penguins = load_penguins()
demonstrate = ['island', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g']

filtered_penguins = penguins[demonstrate]
print(filtered_penguins)

```
